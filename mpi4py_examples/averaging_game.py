"""
To run, first install mpi4py in your conda environment (`conda install -c conda-forge mpi4py openmpi`), then run
`mpiexec -n 4 python filename.py`

GOAL:
Consider agents located on a directed network as shown:

A-->B
^   |
|   |
V   V
C<->D   

Each agent holds a real number. Time moves forward in discrete steps. At every time step, each agent changes their
number to be the average of all of their upstream neighbors' numbers at the previous time step.

I aim to implement this using separate CPU processes for each agent, using mpi4py.
